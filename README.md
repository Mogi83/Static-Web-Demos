# Static Web Demos

## Purpose

Welcome to my Static Web Demo repository! This repository showcases a variety of JavaScript projects and experiments that I have built while learning web development. Some demos may be similar to tutorials or completely unrelated; I use this site to explore what interests me about web development, without requiring the backend of a dynamic site.

## Getting Started

You can view the live site at this link [Static Web Demos](https://mogi83.github.io/Static-Web-Demos/). To explore locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Mogi83/Static-Web-Demos.git
   ```
2. **Run a local web server:**
   ```
   python -m http.server
   ```
3. **Open `localhost:your port number from running the web server`:**
   Then navigate to wherever you have saved the clone and open `index.html` to see the site.

## What to Expect

Each demo on this site is part of my ongoing learning process in web development. I document my experiences and the techniques I use in [blog posts](https://mogi83.github.io). Check out my blog for insights into the development and functionality of each demo. Demos are often grouped into larger articles or update posts. Use the blog's search function to find the post related to the demo you are interested in.
